üéì Short Intro: Hello there! I‚Äôm a PhD Researcher in Natural Language Processing and AI, supervised by Dr. Anders S√∏gaard, in the [CoAStaL Lab](https://coastalcph.github.io) at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen. Additionally, I am involved with the [Centre of Philosophy of AI](https://sites.google.com/view/cpaicph/home), exploring the societal and ethical dimensions of AI.

üß† Research Interests: My core research focus is on the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs), with a particular emphasis on assessing their diverse capabilities and humanlike behaviors. I aim to make these systems' strengths and limitations more interpretable, measurable, and actionable for developers, policymakers, and end-users alike. To do so, I draw on interdisciplinary methods and insights from Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Social Sciences.

üë• Volunteering: I‚Äôm also a community lead at [Cohere Labs](https://cohere.com/research) , where I host talks, socials, and meetups to foster open-source research and collaborations in AI, emphasizing ethical and accessible approaches.

üö∂üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è Hobbies: When I‚Äôm not immersed in research, I enjoy reading about International Relations and Economics.
