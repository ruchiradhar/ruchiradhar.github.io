üéì Hello there! I'm a PhD Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen. I work with Dr. Anders S√∏gaard and the amazing people at [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io/) to investigate reasoning and understanding capabilities of AI systems

üí≠ Additionally, I am involved with the [Centre of Philosophy of AI](https://sites.google.com/view/cpaicph/home) at the university. This collaboration allows me to delve into the philosophical dimensions of artificial intelligence, enriching my understanding beyond code and algorithms.

üß† I'm primarily interested in understanding compositionality (NOT just multi-hop reasoning) in natural and artificial systems by looking at the representations & behaviours of minds and machines. My research encompasses AI, Machine Learning, Cognitive Science, linguistics, neuroscience, and philosophy-  aiming to decode the mechanisms behind machine language capabilities.

üö∂üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è When I‚Äôm not immersed in research, I enjoy playing badminton and taking long, contemplative walks to clear my mind and gain new perspectives.


### Updates

The first work of my PhD- "From Words to Worlds: Compositionality for Cognitive Architectures" - was accepted to the [LLMs & Cognition](https://llm-cognition.github.io/) workshop at [International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2024](https://icml.cc/), Vienna. See you in July in Austria! 

Our abstract for an oral presentation titled *"The Completeness Problem: Beyond Human Metrics in Assessing Abilities of Cognitive Systems"* was accepted to the [International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience (ACAIN) 2024](https://acain2024.icas.events/symposium/). Looking forward to the Tuscan sun in September!
