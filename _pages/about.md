üéì Short Intro: Hello there! I'm a PhD Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen. I work with Dr. Anders S√∏gaard and the amazing people at [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io/) to investigate compositionality, reasoning and understanding capabilities of AI systems like LLMs with a specific focus on interpretability and evaluation. Additionally, I am involved with the [Centre of Philosophy of AI](https://sites.google.com/view/cpaicph/home) at the university. 

üß† Research Interests: I'm primarily interested in understanding compositionality in natural and artificial systems by looking at the representations & behaviours of minds and machines. My research encompasses AI, Machine Learning, Cognitive Science, linguistics, neuroscience, and philosophy-  aiming to decode the mechanisms behind machine language capabilities.

üë• Volunteering: I'm also a community lead at [Cohere for AI](https://cohere.com/research) (C4AI) and host talks/socials/meetups to foster open source research in AI. 

üö∂üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è  Hobbies: When I‚Äôm not immersed in research, I enjoy playing badminton and taking long, contemplative walks to clear my mind and gain new perspectives.


### Updates

Super happy to announce that our paper titled "Investigating the role of modality and training objective on representational alignment between transformers and the brain" was accepted to the [Unireps Workshop](https://unireps.org/2024/) at NeurIPS 2024! More details coming soon. 

My work with co-author Constanza Fierro, titled *"Defining Knowledge: Bridging Epistemology and Large Language Models"* was accepted to [EMNLP Main Conference, 2024](https://2024.emnlp.org)! 

The first work of my PhD- *"From Words to Worlds: Compositionality for Cognitive Architectures"* - was accepted to the [LLMs & Cognition](https://llm-cognition.github.io/) workshop at [International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2024](https://icml.cc/), Vienna. See you in July in Austria! 

Our abstract for an oral presentation titled *"The Completeness Problem: Beyond Human Metrics in Assessing Abilities of Cognitive Systems"* was accepted to the [International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience (ACAIN) 2024](https://acain2024.icas.events/symposium/).
