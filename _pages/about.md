üéì Short Intro: Hello there! I‚Äôm a PhD Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen. I work with Dr. Anders S√∏gaard and the amazing people at CoAStaL to develop cognitive and human-centric evaluation frameworks for AI systems like LLMs. My work focuses on creating explainable and interpretable evaluation methods that makes analyzing these systems more accessible for all stakeholders. Additionally, I am involved with the Centre of Philosophy of AI at the university, exploring the societal and ethical dimensions of AI evaluation including AI policy and governance.

üß† Research Interests: My primary research interest lies in building evaluation frameworks that bridge the gap between technical AI capabilities and human-centric needs. This involves studying the cognitive abilities and humanlike behaviors of AI systems to make their capabilities interpretable and useful for diverse stakeholders, including developers, policymakers, and end-users. I integrate insights from AI, Machine Learning, Cognitive Science, Linguistics, and Philosophy to advance this goal.

üë• Volunteering: I‚Äôm also a community lead at Cohere for AI (C4AI), where I host talks, socials, and meetups to foster open-source research and collaborations in AI, emphasizing ethical and accessible approaches.

üö∂üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è Hobbies: When I‚Äôm not immersed in research, I enjoy playing badminton and taking long, contemplative walks to the ass end of nowhere.
