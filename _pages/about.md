🎓 Hello there! I'm a PhD Researcher in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen. I work with Dr. Anders Søgaard and the amazing people at [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io/) to investigate reasoning and understanding capabilities of AI systems

💭 Additionally, I am involved with the [Centre of Philosophy of AI](https://sites.google.com/view/cpaicph/home) at the university. This collaboration allows me to delve into the philosophical dimensions of artificial intelligence, enriching my understanding beyond code and algorithms.

🧠 I'm primarily interested in understanding compositionality (NOT just multi-hop reasoning) in natural and artificial systems by looking at the representations & behaviours of minds and machines. My research encompasses AI, Machine Learning, Cognitive Science, linguistics, neuroscience, and philosophy-  aiming to decode the mechanisms behind machine language capabilities.

🚶🏽‍♀️‍➡️ When I’m not immersed in research, I enjoy playing badminton and taking long, contemplative walks to clear my mind and gain new perspectives.
