🎓 Hey there! Guess who's diving headfirst into the world of doctoral research at the cool kids' table in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen?  🚀 With the guidance of Dr. Anders Soegaard, I'm on a mission to unlock the mysteries of LLMs, language and cognition! Oh, and did I mention I'm a proud [CoAStaLer](https://coastalcph.github.io/)?

💭 And that's not all! I'm also hanging out with the cool cats over at the [Centre of Philosophy of AI](https://sites.google.com/view/cpaicph/home) at the university. Because, you know, it's not just about code and algorithms; we've gotta ponder the deep questions too! 🤔

🧠 My research journey delves into the depths of cognitive science, linguistics, neuroscience, and even philosophy to decode how machines talk the talk!"

🚶🏽‍♀️‍➡️When I'm not unraveling the secrets of AI language prowess, you can find me embarking on walks to the far reaches of nowhere. Yep, I'm all about those long walks to...well, wherever the wind takes me! 🌍
