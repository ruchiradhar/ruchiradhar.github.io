üéì Short Intro: Hello there! I‚Äôm a PhD Researcher in Natural Language Processing and AI, supervised by Dr. Anders S√∏gaard, in the [CoAStaL Lab](https://coastalcph.github.io) at the Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen. Additionally, I am involved with the [Centre of Philosophy of AI](https://cpai.ku.dk/), exploring the societal and ethical dimensions of AI.

üß† Research Interests: My research focus is on the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs)- How do we know if a model is "good" or "safe"? How do we know if a model is actually better than other? Are our current evaluation practices (data, metrics, scores) rigorous enough to measure actual scientific progress of the field? What can we do to make these systems' strengths and limitations more interpretable and actionable for the general public?. On a related note, I'm also interested in AI Policy and Governance and how evaluation practices can play a key role in such efforts.

üë• Volunteering: I‚Äôm a community lead at [Cohere Labs](https://cohere.com/research) ,formerly Cohere For AI, where I host talks, socials, and meetups to foster open-source research and collaborations in AI research. I also serve as a volunteer teacher at the non-profit [eVidyaloka](https://www.evidyaloka.org/).

üö∂üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Äç‚û°Ô∏è Hobbies: I love reading about art history and dabbling in oil painting!

üì¢ Contact: Feel free to get in touch via *rudh@di.ku.dk* if you wanna talk more about my work.
